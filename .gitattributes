# Git attributes for CyberX Event Management System

# Environment-specific configuration files
# Use 'ours' merge strategy to keep the target branch's version during merges
# This prevents staging config from overwriting production config (and vice versa)
render.yaml merge=ours

# Explanation:
# - When merging staging → main: Keep main's render.yaml (production config)
# - When merging main → staging: Keep staging's render.yaml (staging config)
# - This ensures each branch maintains its own environment configuration

# Optional: Protect other environment-specific files if they diverge between branches
# Uncomment these if you have branch-specific versions of these files:
# .env merge=ours
# docker-compose.yml merge=ours
# backend/alembic.ini merge=ours
