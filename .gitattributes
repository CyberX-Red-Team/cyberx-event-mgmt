# Git attributes for CyberX Event Management System

# Environment-specific configuration files
# Use 'ours' merge strategy to keep the target branch's version during merges
# This prevents staging config from overwriting production config (and vice versa)

# - When merging staging → main: Keep main's render.yaml (production config)
# - When merging main → staging: Keep staging's render.yaml (staging config)
# - This ensures each branch maintains its own environment configuration
